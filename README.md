# JavaGWC2023
Contains the sample projects and classwork, I created for the Spring 2023 GWC Java session. 


The GroceryStoreSample.py file is an example of the many samples I made. It contains starter code as well as annotations to help students understand and add-on to the file. Alternatively it can be used for reference.
